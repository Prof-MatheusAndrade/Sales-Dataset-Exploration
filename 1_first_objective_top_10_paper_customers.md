In the left section of the dashboard, a bar graph highlights the top 10 customers by revenue, identified by Customer ID and colored by segment. Simultaneously, the right section complements the analysis with a visual representation of revenue versus each segment.

## Dashboard Insights

To address the objective, users can easily identify the top 10 customers in the bar graph, ranked by revenue. The number of segments covered by each customer is visually represented, providing valuable insights into the distribution of revenue across different segments. The total revenue by segment is also depicted on the right axis, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the market dynamics.

This dashboard not only fulfills the requirements of Objective 1 but also serves as a powerful tool for stakeholders to gain actionable insights into the top paper customers and their segmentation in the market.
