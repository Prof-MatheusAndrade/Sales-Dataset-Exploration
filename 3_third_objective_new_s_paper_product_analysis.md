In the upper left section, the revenue results of Xerox 1908 are depicted by city in a map view. The upper right section features a two Y-axis graph displaying the total sales and the number of orders by each city. The lower section showcases a two Y-axis graph with total sales and the number of orders by the Order Date, colored by customer ID.

## Dashboard Insights
To address the objective, detailed insights into the performance of Xerox 1908 were gleaned, aiding in the formulation of recommendations for launching the New's Paper product. Notably, Xerox 1908 exhibits limited orders, totaling only 7, and is predominantly concentrated in the USA, specifically in 6 cities indicated in the graphs.

Key observations:

**-> Market Presence**: Xerox 1908 has a market presence in the USA, with more specific traction in six cities.

**-> Top Performing Cities**: Wheeling and New York City emerge as top-performing cities, particularly for the Home Office and Corporate segments.

**-> Strategic Recommendations**: Considering these insights, the company could create a targeted marketing strategy in Wheeling, Chicago, and Los Angeles for the Home Office segment. Additionally, investing in New York City could be strategic for the Corporate segment, and Roswell may present opportunities for the Consumer segment.
In terms of offering a 10% discount coupon for their first New’s Paper purchase, it is advisable to target specific customers. Instead of solely focusing on the top 3 customers by revenue, a more effective approach is to consider the top 3 customers based on the order date, prioritizing the most recent significant orders:

1. DK-131504 from Roswell - Consumer segment
2. EH-141224 from Wheeling - Home Office segment
3. BT-115304 from Los Angeles - Home Office segment

This targeted approach ensures that the 10% discount coupon is offered to customers with a recent history of substantial orders, increasing the likelihood of successful conversion and maximizing the impact of the marketing initiative.
