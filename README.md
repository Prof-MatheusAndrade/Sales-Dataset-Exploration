# Sales Dataset Exploration

Welcome to the repository for the data analysis project undertaken by Company Inc, a leading paper and office supplies wholesale company. This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for exploring and understanding the insights derived from the analysis of Company Holding's transactional data.

## Dataset Information
The dataset under consideration can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatihilhan/global-superstore-dataset).

It encompasses transactional data relevant to Company Inc's operations, with a specific focus on the Office Supplies category.

## Objectives
The primary goal of this analysis is to assist Company Inc in gaining valuable insights into the paper market. To achieve this, we aim to answer the following key questions:

1. Top 10 Paper Customers: Identify the top 10 paper customers, ranked by revenue. Determine the number of segments covered by these top customers.

2. Top 10 Paper Products: Identify the top 10 paper products, ranked by revenue. Investigate the locations and regions where the top 10 products have more impact.
   
3. New’s Paper Product Analysis: Provide strategic recommendations for the new product, New’s Paper, as a substitute for Xerox 1908 with a better price. Advise on the target region and segment for New’s Paper advertisement. Recommend customers for whom a 10% discount coupon for their first New’s Paper purchase would be beneficial.

4. Relationship Between Ship Mode and Time to Ship: Investigate the correlation between Ship Mode and the "Time to Ship." Define "Time to Ship" as the difference between Ship date and Order Date.
   
5. Office Supplies Market Trend: Analyze the trend in the Office Supplies market. Provide a forecast for the upcoming year (2015).
